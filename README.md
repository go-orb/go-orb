Orb is a framework for distributed systems development, it can be seen as the successor of [go-micro.dev/v4](https://github.com/go-micro/go-micro).

## :warning: WIP

This project is a work in progress, please do not use yet!

## :rocket: What's new since v4

### Use of [wire](https://github.com/google/wire)

With wire we gain:

- compile-time safety
- no more globals

It was the main reason for starting orb, wire allows us to decouple the components and plugins.

### No more reflect

we have been working hard on removing all usage of reflect.

### Multiple Entrypoints

Orb allows you to listen on multiple port's with different protocols: gRPC, HTTP, HTTP2, H2C, HTTP3.
See the config system entry on howto configure it.

### Advanced [config system](config)

With orb you can configure your plugins with a config file or environment options.

```yaml
service1:
  server:
    http:
      gzip: true
      handlers:
        - Streams
      # middleware:
      #   - middleware-1
      entrypoints:
        - name: ep1
          address: :4512
          insecure: true
          h2c: true
  registry:
    enabled: true
    plugin: mdns
    timeout: 350
    domain: svc.orb
```

```yaml
service1:
  server:
    grpc:
      insecure: true
      handlers:
        - Streams
      # middleware:
      #   - middleware-1
      # streamMiddleware:
      #   - middleware-S1
      entrypoints:
        - name: ep1
          address: :4512
          health: false
          reflection: false
          # handlers:
          #   - handler-1
          #   - handler-2
          # middleware:
          #   - middleware-1
          #   - middleware-4
  registry:
    plugin: nats
    address: nats://10.0.0.1:4222
    quorum: false
```

These 2 config's with different options will both work, we first parse the config, get the "plugin" from it and pass a `map[any]any` with all config data to the plugin.

Both work with a single binary. :)

### Proto conform handlers

Return types as a result instead of HTTP req format.

New:

```go
req := HelloRequest{Name: "test"}

// Look at resp, it's now returned as a result.
resp , err := client.Call[HelloResponse](context.Background(), clientDi, "org.orb.svc.hello", "Say.Hello", &req)
```

Old:

```go
req := c.c.NewRequest(c.serviceName, "Greeter.Hello", in)
out := new(HelloResponse)
err := c.c.Call(ctx, req, out, opts...)
if err != nil {
  return nil, err
}
return out, nil
```

#### Structured logging

We like structured logging, this is why we replaced all logging with one based on [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog).

#### go-orb/go-orb is just interfaces

We made sure that go-orb/go-orb (the core) is just a bunch of interfaces as well as some glue code, the most real code lives in [go-orb/plugins](https://github.com/go-orb/plugins).

#### Linted and analyzed

We make sure everything is linted and staticaly analyzed by golangcli-lint. This is enforced by CI/CD pipelines here on github.

## Community

Chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sggGS389qb).

## Development

### Quirks

#### No go-orb/plugins imports here

To prevent import cycles it's not allowed to import github.com/go-orb/plugins here.

#### Lint

We do not accept commits that fail to lint, either use `./scripts/test.sh lint all` or install [Trunk](https://trunk.io/) and it's extension for your editor.
